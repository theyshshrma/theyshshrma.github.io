                                            <p>
                                                I have a very good understanding of programming principles and
                                                techniques. I am proficient in the C# programming language, which is the
                                                language used by Unity. I can use C# to create efficient and reusable
                                                code, which is essential for creating large and complex games.

                                                <br><br>
                                                Some of the programming skills I have include:
                                                <br><br>
                                                <b> • Object-oriented programming (OOP)</b> <br>
                                                I have a strong understanding of OOP concepts, such as classes,
                                                objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. I use these concepts to
                                                create reusable and modular code that is easy to maintain and
                                                extend.

                                                <br><br> <b> • C#</b> <br>
                                                I am proficient in the C# programming language. I am familiar with
                                                the syntax, semantics, and libraries of C#, and I can use it to
                                                create efficient and effective code.

                                                <br><br> <b> • Game mechanics</b> <br>
                                                I have a deep understanding of game mechanics. I know how to create
                                                the rules and interactions that govern how a game works. I can also
                                                use game mechanics to create fun and engaging gameplay experiences.

                                                <br><br> <b> • Algorithms</b> <br>
                                                I am familiar with a variety of algorithms, such as
                                                sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and graph algorithms. I
                                                can use these algorithms to solve problems in game development, such
                                                as pathfinding and collision detection.
                                                <br><br> <b> • Data structures</b> <br>
                                                I am familiar with a variety of data structures,
                                                such as arrays, lists, queues, and stacks. I can use these data
                                                structures to store and manipulate game data efficiently.

                                                <br><br> <b> • Debugging</b> <br>
                                                I am an experienced debugger. I can use a variety of
                                                debugging tools to find and fix errors in my code. I am also
                                                familiar with common debugging techniques, such as print statements,
                                                breakpoints, and logging.

                                                <br><br> <b> • Profiling</b> <br>
                                                I am familiar with the process of profiling code. I can
                                                use profiling tools to measure the performance of my code and
                                                identify performance bottlenecks. I can then use this information to
                                                optimize my code and improve the performance of my games.

                                                <br><br> <b> • Version control</b> <br>
                                                I am an experienced user of version control
                                                systems. I use version control to track changes to my code and
                                                assets. This helps me to prevent errors and facilitate collaboration
                                                with other developers.

                                                <br><br>
                                                I am excited to continue my career as a Unity game developer. I am
                                                passionate about creating games that people enjoy playing, and I am
                                                confident that I have the skills and knowledge to make a significant
                                                contribution to the game development industry.

                                                <br><br>
                                                Here are some additional programming skills that I am working on
